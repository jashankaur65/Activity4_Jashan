## Additional Information

I learnt how to use Python's Slot decorator in this activity. This activity had 2 parts. First one included two fields name and number which needed to be displayed in their specific cells and in the second part we needed to add different tasks in three different categories like Backlog, In progress and Done. the main problem I faced was with the saving part. In the saving as csv part we needed to save the save the tasks we have added to a csv file. I couldn't get to code to do so but after searching it online i did found a way to do so other than that everything went well.
